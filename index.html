            <p class="header-text"> <em> The term "ecosystem" was first used in 1935 in a publication by British ecologist Arthur Tansley. Tansley devised the concept to draw attention to the importance of transfers of materials between organisms and their environment. He later refined the term, describing it as "The whole system, including not only the organism-complex, but also the whole complex of physical factors forming what we call the environment". Tansley regarded ecosystems not simply as natural units, but as "mental isolates". Tansley later defined the spatial extent of ecosystems using the term "ecotope".</em></p>

                  <p> Ecosystem Restoration is the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded. There are no longer healthy wetlands, dynamic Coral reefs and rich forests perceived today. Anything that is observed is pollution and contamination which leads to poor AQI.</p>
