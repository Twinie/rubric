    <p> The way we are using many of these lands is exhausting their vitality. Intensive ploughing and monocultures, overgrazing and the removal of hedges and trees are degrading precious soil and vegetation. Excess agrochemicals are polluting waterways and harming wildlife, including bees that pollinate crops. We can restore rural ecosystems by using nature to boost farm productivity and soil health and improve how they manage the land. Here are some of the options for farmers and live-stock keepers.</p>
    <p>Invest in nature: Reduce tillage and use natural pest control and organic fertilizer on arable land to build the health of your soil and the yields of your crops while reducing erosion and the need for farm chemicals.</p>
    <p>Trust in diversity: Grow more trees and a greater variety of crops and integrate them with livestock keeping to further boost soil health, diversify your income and provide better wildlife habitat. Plant-ing flowers along the borders of farmlands can provide valuable “feeding stations” for bees and other pollinators.</p>
    <p>Keep grasslands whole: In extensive grasslands and savannahs, protect areas along rivers where nutrients are high from being converted to crop-land. Without them, less productive areas are harder to use sustainably.</p>
    <p>Graze sustainably: Agree on grazing regimes that prevent overuse, soil erosion and invasions of grasslands by shrubs and alien species. Restore already degraded areas by clearing woody vege-tation and re-seeding native grasses.</p>
    <p>Bring back indigenous species: Reintroduce eradicated plants, trees and animals and pro-tect them from predation and hunting until they are established.</p>
